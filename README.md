## üí° Project Overview
**Ordem dos Livros** is a modern and interactive web application designed for literature enthusiasts who want to explore detailed information about authors, books, and literary data ‚Äî as well as follow the chronological or publication order of books within a series.

The project allows users to browse organized book lists, access full author biographies, and read comprehensive reviews that offer valuable insights into each work. 

It also provides a fast and efficient search experience, enabling users to quickly find specific information about authors or titles.

## ü§î About the Project

This project was developed as part of my ongoing journey transitioning into **front-end development** after several years working in the digital sector.  

It was created as a deliverable for the **Forma√ß√£o.DEV**, where I‚Äôm currently studying full-time to deepen my technical skills and build a strong, practical portfolio.

The main goal of this project was to apply and strengthen my knowledge of **Svelte, TypeScript and TailwindCSS**.  
It represents my commitment to learning through hands-on experience and delivering clean, functional, and user-focused applications.

With a background in **web development (WordPress), technical SEO, and digital project management**, I combine fresh technical skills with a solid understanding of how design, functionality, and performance work together in real-world web environments.

**Key takeaways:**  
- Applied modern front-end technologies in a real project context.  
- Reinforced problem-solving and UI implementation skills.  
- Continued building a portfolio that reflects both learning and technical evolution.
